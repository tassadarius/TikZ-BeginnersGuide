## Disclaimer

TikZ is very versatile. There are many ways of doing it, so please take these
only as reference and don't be confused when others do it differently.
This is the TikZ style I found to work for me. I know there are dozens of way to do things better,
use libraries etc. Feel free to make suggestions for improvement!
